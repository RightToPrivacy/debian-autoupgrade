# debian-autoupgrade

Automatic upgrades for Debian as a Systemd Service
based on my "beginner shell scripting" (off the cuff idea) video: 
' https://odysee.com/@RTP/linux-lesson-bash-scripting-taking-input '

Simply run:

    sudo bash install.sh 
    
and enjoy your automatic upgrades

#### To disable:
    systemctl disable upgrade.service
    
#### To stop:
    systemctl stop upgrade.service

Should work on all Debian based Linux systems including:

Armbian
Mobian (Pinephone/Librem5)
Debian Linux OS
Parrot Linux OS
Linux Mint
Ubuntu
Rapberry OS (Raspbian)

and any other Debian based system.
